Purpose of this project is to provide an environment for building learning systems.

Simulated environments of increased complexity will be used to train predictive/reactive systems.

## Simulations

### Associative predictors

Sequences of inputs are presented as a training to an Associative Predictor (AP).
 The purpose of AP is to predict part of the input where there is a
 pattern.



### Musical Instrument

Reactor needs to learn to play melodies on a simulated instrument.
