Purpose of this project is to provide an environment for building learning systems.

Simulated environments of increased complexity will be used to train predictive/reactive systems.

## Learning System

What is a Learning System?

Here is a possible definition of a minimal learning system that
could interact with some environment, whatever that bould be

### Components of an Learning System

#### 0. Perceptors and Effectors
1. Inputs from the environment
2. Means of acting in the environment

####1. Entities Modeling

1. recognize (delimit)
    - inputs are associated to new or known entities

2. classify
    - a hierarchy of entities is used to place an entity

3. track
    - entity is interaly represented even if not directtly observable

4. remember / compare
5. #### Actions
    1. recognize in terms of entities
    2. remember / compare


####2. Manipulate Environment

 1. model effectors and their actions
    Pro
 2. model responses
    1. likelihoods/ certainty or each outcome


####3. Predicting
 1. predict likely outcome of actions


####4. Planing
1. emotions (good/bad/needed)
    1. mark actions, entities, predictions
2. react to good/bad predictions (opportunities/treats)
3. plan to fulfill the needs






## Simulations

### Associative predictors

Sequences of inputs are presented as a training to an Associative Predictor (AP).
 The purpose of AP is to predict part of the input where there is a
 pattern.



### Musical Instrument

Reactor needs to learn to play melodies on a simulated instrument.
